# Word Cloud from .txt file
This is a simple word cloud creator I made as the final project for Google's Crash Course on Python. You need to upload a .txt file (I have provided a sample in this repository, but you can use any .txt file on your computer).

Contents:
- Jupyter Notebook executable file with instructions
- Sample .txt file for setup and testing
